## Installing IsaacLab (~20 min)

If you already have Isaac Lab installed, feel free to move directly to installing Wheeled Lab. Though, we recommend at least creating a new Conda environment for Isaac Lab + Wheeled Lab development.

<details>
  <summary><b>Ubuntu 22.04</b></summary>
  
  ### Setup Conda Environment

  While this isn't technically necessary, we highly recommend using conda to keep dependencies and packages organized. 

  Conda can be installed [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html).

  ```bash
  # Create a conda environment named WL
  conda create -n WL python=3.10
  conda activate WL
  ```

  ### Install Isaac Sim

  We'll be installing Isaac Sim v4.5.0 here because WheeledLab was developed with 4.5.0 (WheeledLab should still work with v5.1.0).

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install 'isaacsim[all,extscache]==4.5.0' --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
  ```

  ### Install Isaac Lab

  ```bash
  # Install Isaac Lab v2.0.2 (make sure you have build dependencies first, e.g. `sudo apt install cmake build-essential` on ubuntu)
  git clone --branch v2.0.2 https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git
  ./isaaclab.sh -i
  ```

  <summary><b>Ubuntu 20.04</b></summary>
  
  ### Setup Conda Environment

  Again, while this isn't technically necessary, we highly recommend using conda to keep dependencies and packages organized. 

  Conda can be installed [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html).

  ```bash
  # Create a conda environment named WL
  conda create -n WL python=3.10
  conda activate WL
  ```

  ### Install Isaac Sim

  1. Download Isaac Sim from the [Isaac Sim website](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/installation/download.html). You can also do this in terminal by running: 

  ```bash
  wget https://download.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaac-sim-standalone-4.5.0-linux-x86_64.zip
  ```
  2. Unzip the binaries. In this example, we'll be unzipping the contents to the folder `isaacsim`.

  ```bash
  # Generally speaking, you want to run "unzip ZIPPED_FOLDER.zip -d DESTINATION_FOLDER"
  unzip isaac-sim-standalone-4.5.0-linux-x86_64.zip -d isaacsim
  ```
  3. Let's make sure Isaac Sim was installed correctly. Go into the `isaacsim` and run `./isaac-sim.sh`. 

  ```bash
  cd isaacsim
  ./isaac-sim.sh

  # If you see something like "Isaac Sim Full App is loaded", you should be good to go. 
  ```

  4. Run `source setup_conda_env.sh` in the isaacsim directory. Example:

  ```bash
  cd isaacsim
  source setup_conda_env.sh
  ```

  <mark>Note! You **MUST** run `source setup_conda_env.sh` every time you start a new session.</mark>

  ### Install Isaac Lab

  ```bash
  # Clone Isaac Lab v2.0.2
  git clone --branch v2.0.2 https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git
  ```

  Next, create a symbolic link between the installed Isaac Sim and the Isaac Lab directory. Do so by running the following in the Isaac Lab folder. 

  ```bash
  cd Isaaclab
  ln -s ~/PATH/TO/ISAAC/SIM/DIRECTORY _isaac_sim
  ```

  Finally, install Isaac Lab extensions by running the following:

  ```bash
  ./isaaclab.sh -i
  ```

  <mark>Warning! The IsaacLab install command (`./isaaclab.sh -i`) automatically installs the newest version of NumPy. **The newest version of NumPy is NOT compatible, so you MUST install NumPy v1.x**. You can do so by running `pip install --force-reinstall "numpy<2"`.</mark>

</details>

## Installing WheeledLab (~5 min)

```bash
# Activate the conda environment that was created via the IsaacLab setup.
conda activate <your IsaacLab env here> # 'WL' if you followed instructions above

git clone git@github.com:UWRobotLearning/WheeledLab.git
cd WheeledLab/source
pip install -e wheeledlab
pip install -e wheeledlab_tasks
pip install -e wheeledlab_assets
pip install -e wheeledlab_rl
```

After this, we recommend [Setting Up VSCode](https://github.com/UWRobotLearning/WheeledLab?tab=readme-ov-file#training-quick-start).

## Training Quick Start

Training runs can take a couple hours to produce a transferable policy.

To start a drifting run:

```bash
python source/wheeledlab_rl/scripts/train_rl.py --headless -r RSS_DRIFT_CONFIG
```

To start a elevation run:

```bash
python source/wheeledlab_rl/scripts/train_rl.py --headless -r RSS_ELEV_CONFIG
```

To start a visual run:

```bash
python source/wheeledlab_rl/scripts/train_rl.py --headless -r RSS_VISUAL_CONFIG
```

Though optional (and free), we strongly advise using [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/) (`wandb`) to record and track training status. Logging to `wandb` is turned on by default. If you would like to disable it, add `train.log.no_wandb=True` to the CLI arguments.

See more details about training in the `wheeledlab_rl` [README.md](source/wheeledlab_rl/docs/README.md)

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter an error such as `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'isaacsim'`, navigate to the Isaac Sim directory and run `source setup_conda_env.sh`. This script must be executed before starting any training run in Wheeled Lab to ensure the environment is set up correctly.

## Deployment

A separate repository is maintained for existing integrations and deployments. See https://github.com/UWRobotLearning/RealLab for code.

### Current Integrations

1. HOUND [1] - https://github.com/UWRobotLearning/RealLab/tree/hound
2. MuSHR [2] - https://github.com/UWRobotLearning/RealLab/tree/mushr
3. F1Tenth [3] - (coming soon)

If you have an integration or request for a platform not seen above, please contact us or consider contributing!

## Setting Up VSCode

It is a million times harder to develop in IsaacLab without Intellisense. Setting up the vscode workspace is
STRONGLY advised.

0. Find where your `IsaacLab` directory currently is. We'll refer to it as `<IsaacLab>` in this section. Move the VSCode tools to this workspace.

   ```bash
   cd <WheeledLab>
   cp -r <IsaacLab>/.vscode/tools ./.vscode/
   cp -r <IsaacLab>/.vscode/*.json ./.vscode/
   ```

1. Change `.vscode/tasks.json` line 11

   ```json
   "command": "${workspaceFolder}/../IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh -p ${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/tools/setup_vscode.py"
   ```

   to

   ```json
   "command": "<IsaacLabDir>/isaaclab.sh -p ${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/tools/setup_vscode.py"
   ```

2. `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to bring up the VSCode command palette. type `Tasks:Run Task` or type until you see it show up and highlight it and press `Enter`.
3. Click on `setup_python_env`. Follow the prompts until you're able to run the task. You should see a console at the bottom and the status of the task.
4. If successful, you should now have `.vscode/{settings.json, launch.json}` in your `<WheeledLab>` repo and `settings.json` should have a populated list of paths under the `"python.analysis.extraPaths"` key.
5. Make sure you at least have Microsoft's Python extension installed for intellisense to work. 

### If it still doesn't work

The `setup_vscode` task doesn't work for me for whatever reason. If that's true for you too, add the following lines to the end of the list under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"` in the `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
    "<IsaacLab>/source/isaaclab",
    "<IsaacLab>/source/isaaclab_assets",
    "<IsaacLab>/source/isaaclab_tasks",
    "<IsaacLab>/source/isaaclab_rl",
```
